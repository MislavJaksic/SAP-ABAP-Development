SmartForms
==========

SmartForms are used for the same purpose as SAPscript, they specify how text is printed onto a piece of paper. SmartFroms have better graphics and their programs are smaller and more modular. SmartForms are made up from three elements: form, style and print program.

SmartForms form
---------------
The form defines windows and texts, controls the print flow and where the basic elements are located.

SmartForms style
----------------
Style defines the look of the text.

SmartForms print program
------------------------
Print programs defines how and which tables will be filled with data from the database tables.

SmartForms function module
--------------------------
Function module can be generated automatically based on the defined style and form. The function module replaces the composer program in SAPscript.

SmartForms tools
----------------
The tools are Form Builder, Form Painter and Table Painter.

SmartForms user settings
------------------------
SMARTFORMS, Utilities, Settings.

Create SmartForms form
----------------------
Never change an existing SmartForm form, always copy it and create a Z named form. SmartForms form has attributes, an interface, global definitions, pages and windows and error messages.

SmartForms form parts
--------------------------
Form attributes have basic attributes and output options.
Form interface defines the input and output parameters which are used to exchange data with the print program.
Global definitions are where variables and structures are defined and declared.
Pages and windows define the visual look of the SmartForm using nodes.
Errors tell what needs to be corrected.

Nodes
-----
Nodes say is what order, what text and where it will be printed. Nodes have attributes.

Fieldlist
---------
Field list allows nodes to be draged and dropped, which speeds up SmartForms development.

SmarfForms form testing
-----------------------
SmartFdorms form can be tested as if it were an ordinary program.

SmartForm translation
---------------------
SmartForms can be translated through SE63 or Tools, R/3 Enterprise, Other Long Texts.
