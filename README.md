## Overview

SAP, which stands for *Systems, Applications, and Products in Data Processing*, is both the name of a corporation and the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system developed by the company. ERP systems like SAP are crucial for ensuring that business processes across large and medium-sized organizations are efficient and effective.

The primary purpose of an ERP system is to digitize and streamline various business processes, including finance, production planning, sales and distribution, material management, and more.

## SAP Modules

SAP is structured into several modules, each designed to handle specific business processes. Examples of these modules include:

- **Finance (FI)**
- **Material Management (MM)**
- **Sales and Distribution (SD)**

Each module covers distinct functions within a business, enabling comprehensive management and integration of operations.

## SAP Development and Customization

While SAP modules provide standardized processes applicable to most businesses, companies often need to customize these modules to meet their unique requirements. Customization is typically managed through the SAP Implementation Guide (IMG), which allows businesses to fine-tune existing programs.

However, in cases where a business's needs are particularly specific, custom development is required. This involves using the programming language ABAP to create new programs tailored to the organization's requirements.

## ABAP

ABAP, or *Advanced Business Application Programming*, is a programming language used almost exclusively within SAP. It shares similarities with COBOL and is the backbone of SAP's extensive functionality.

Learning ABAP can be challenging due to the limited availability of free, well-structured tutorials. This repository was created to help bridge that gap.

## Other SAP Tools

SAP offers a wide range of programming and development tools to enhance and extend its capabilities, including:

- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**
- **SmartForms** (a graphical document editor)
- **ALE** (tools for SAP to connect and communicate with other systems)
- **eCATT** (a testing suite for SAP environments)
