SAPscript
=========

SAPscript is used to specify the look and feel of business documents on a piece of paper. SAPscript is language
dependant. SAPscript is client dependant.

Print program
-------------
Print program is responsible for retrieving the data from the SAP system and for the control logic of the output.

Composer
---------
composer formats lines and executes script commands. The composer is sent data from the print program and the script.

User SAPscript settings
-----------------------
SE71, Settings, Form Painter, Graphical Editor and Painter Option.

Create SAPscript form
---------------------
SAPscript forms are never changed on the original 000 client. Instead, copy the SAPscript from the client 000 and
then change it.

Copy SAPscript from another client
----------------------------------
SE71, Utilities, Copy from Client, select a SAPscript and choose a new Z target form name.

SAPscript elements
------------------
SAPscript elements are header, layout, paragraph format and character format (there are others as well but they are
not as important).

SAPscript header
----------------
Header holds administrative data and basic settings.

SAPscript layout
----------------
Layout defines the look of SAPscript. Layout defines what types of pages will be printed and what the pages contain.
Windows define where the data will be printed.

SAPscript layout windows
------------------------
Windows have different types. The most important window type is MAIN. MAIN is filled with data after the composer 
has processed all static windows. The position of the window within the layout can be set and changed. Each window 
has static texts and variables that will be printed. The contents of each window can be seen with the Line Editor.

Window Line Editor
------------------
Line editor has two columns. The first column defines the format and the second column defines the data. There are 
special format characters. Text can be structured into text elements. Variables within text are marked with &_var&. 
A valid variable name is a structure defined within the print program. Variables can be formatted. Some system 
symbols can also be embedded within the text. SAPscript commands also exist and can be written with the text.

Paragraph format
----------------
Paragraph format are elements which allow texts to be formatted at the level of text lines. The most important 
paragraph format elements are fonts and tabs. Tab is marked within text with ',,'. 

Character format
----------------
Character format is used to change the way a line is printed. Character format's most important feature is the font 
type. Font is defined with <_char_format>_text</>.

Standard texts
--------------
Standard text is a text that is often used in multiple SAPscripts such as header or footer information. They are 
defined in SO10. Each text has a Z name, ID and language. Standard text is formatted in the same way as a SAPscript 
form.

SAPscript graphics
------------------
SAPscript graphics should be stored on a document server. Graphics must be imported before they are used. 

SAPscript styles
----------------
Styles define how a group of standard texts or SAPscript forms look. Style has a header, paragraph format and 
character format.

Symbols and control commands
----------------------------
Symbols are variables that will be replaced upon execution with actual text. They are inserted in the Line Editor 
with Insert, Symbols. There are system, standard, program and text symbols.

Print program construction
--------------------------
Print programs are made up of function module invocations. OPEN_FORM and CLOSE_FORM must be used as they open the 
form for printing. START_FORM and END_FORM are used when more forms will be combined into one spool request. 
WRITE_FORM controls text element printing.
WRITE_FORM has the following parameters: element specifies which text element will be printed, function says how it 
will be printed (append, replace, delete), type says where in the window will it be printed and window says in which
window it will be printed.

SAPscript customizing
---------------------
Customizing is done in transaction SPRO. Customizing SAPscript is done in many places, but it is done most commonly 
is SD, MM and FI (Sales and Distribution, Material Management and Finance). Options are located inder the Output 
Control node.


Special format characters
-------------------------
*	predefine header
/	new line
=	continue previous line
/: 	SAPscript command line
/* 	comment
/E 	text element

Variable format
---------------
&table-field(n)& 	write the first n characters
&table-field(.1)& 	write the number with 1 decimal place
&table-field(Z)& 	leave out leading zeroes
&table-field(S)& 	leave out the sign (+, -)
&table-field(<)& 	write the sign to the left
&table-field(>)& 	write the sign to the right

System symbols
--------------
&DATE& 				system date
&TIME& 				system time
&PAGE& 				current page
&ULINE(X)& 			write out a x character long horizontal line
&VLINE(Y)& 			write out a x character long vertical line

SAPscript commands
------------------
NEW-PAGE 			force a page break
PROTECT and END-PROTECT	 makes sure the data in the block isn't broken up onto two pages
INCLUDE	for icluding standard texts during printing
IF (ELSE) ENDIF	conditional block
BOX, POSITION, SIZE	frame printing

Control commands
----------------
/: 	INCLUDE
for including long text in the script
/: 	DEFINE
for assigning values to text symbols
/: 	ADDRESS … ENDADDRESS
for formatting adresses
/: 	PROTECT … ENDPROTECT
makes sure the data in the block isn't broken up onto two pages
/: 	NEW-PAGE
force a page break
/: 	IF … ENDIF
conditional block
/:	CASE … ENDCASE
conditional block

Including text and loading graphics
-----------------------------------
INCLUDE &ZTEXT& OBJECT TEXT ID ADRS LANGUAGE E.
In Line Editor use Insert, Text, Standard Text.
BITMAP 'Z_NAZIV' OBJECT GRAPHICS ID BMAP TYPE BMON ( BCOL)
In Line Editor use Insert, Graphics.

PERFORM..ENDPERFORM
-------------------
In SAPscript PERFORM is used to invoke a routine in a program. An example of syntax follows:
/:	DEFINE &SIFRA_POR& =  ' '
/:	PERFORM POREZ IN PROGRAM ZTEST_OBRASCI
/:	USING &VBDKR-KUNRG&
/:	CHANGING &SIFRA_POR&
/:	ENDPERFORM

...somewhere else...

REPORT ZTEST_FORM.

FORM TAXES
      TABLES input_table STRUCTURE ITCSY
             output_table STRUCTURE ITCSY.

  TABLES: kna1.
  DATA: vendor_code TYPE n.

  REFRESH output_table.
  READ TABLE input_table WITH KEY name = 'VBDRK-KUNRG'.
  MOVE input_table-value TO vendor_code.

  SELECT SINGLE * FROM kna1
    WHERE kunnr = vendor_code.

  IF sy-subrc EQ 0.
    MOVE 'TAX_CODE' TO output_table-name.
    MOVE kna1-stcd1 TO output_table-value.
    APPEND output_table.
  ENDIF.

ENDFORM.
