## [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

Project Euler is an archive of hundreds upon hundreds of mathematical problems.  
These problems can only be elegantly solved using an algorithm.  
Beacuse of this, these problems are tailor made for learning the basic syntax of a language as well as for
practicing code modularization.  

### Solutions

Each solution has its own file who's name corresponds to the ID of the problem in the archive.  
Some functions were extracted and put into their own file as well.
